# Refactoring Log - nids_v1

This log details the improvements made to the `nids_v1` project.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Robust User Input Handling

-   **File:** `src/main.rs`
-   **Change:** Replaced `.expect()` with a validation loop to prevent crashes on invalid user input.
-   **Impact:** Improved application stability and user experience.

### 2. Centralized Error Handling

-   **File:** `src/main.rs`
-   **Change:** Modified the `main` function to return a `Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>`, enabling the use of the `?` operator for cleaner error propagation.
-   **Impact:** More idiomatic and maintainable error handling.

### 3. Decoupled Capture and Parsing with Callbacks

-   **Files:** `src/capture.rs`, `src/main.rs`
-   **Change:**
    -   Refactored `start_capture` to accept a generic closure (callback) for packet processing.
    -   Updated `main.rs` to pass a closure to `start_capture`, which then calls the `handle_packet` function.
-   **Impact:** Decoupled the packet capture logic from the parsing logic, making the components more modular, reusable, and easier to test independently.

### 4. Simplified and Corrected Packet Parsing

-   **File:** `src/parser.rs`
-   **Change:**
    -   Removed the `PacketData` struct and its `new` function, which were the source of the ownership and borrowing errors.
    -   The `handle_packet` function now directly processes the `EthernetPacket` and subsequent layers, avoiding the complex ownership issues of the previous implementation.
-   **Impact:** This change resolves the compilation errors and provides a more robust and idiomatic way to parse packets with `pnet`. The code is now simpler, more efficient, and less prone to ownership-related bugs.
